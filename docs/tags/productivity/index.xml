      <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe all of us have a goal to achieve in life. but sometimes it just feels hard to achieve and we do not know where we should start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to develop and publish my own games but as time pass, I feel pretty lazy, tired especially after work. I usually work on my games in my free times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, my senior told me about Smart Framework, I read about it but I failed to really understand it. Because the article I read that time is not pretty clear and to the point for me. But today in the meeting we talk about Smart Framework and I got more understanding of that framework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
